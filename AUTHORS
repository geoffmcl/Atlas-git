The code in this package has been written by these people:

Per Liedman, liedman@home.se (most of the current code, project coordinator)
Curtis L. Olson, curt@flightgear.org (patches and ideas)
Christian Mayer, vader@t-online.de (some MSVC patches and the PostScript code)
Norman Vine, nhv@cape.com (coordinate printing and some misc. stuff)

Parts of the Atlas project is based on a nice Perl-script that was written
by Alexei Novikov (anovikov@heron.itep.ru).

If anyone feels that they have been forgotten in this list, please contact
liedman@home.se and I will fix it ASAP.
