New in 0.4.0
== Atlas ==
* The world is now rendered as a sphere, rather than a flat map.
* Atlas now directly reads FlightGear scenery when zoomed in close.
  Pre-rendered maps are still used when zoomed out.  When using "live"
  scenery, Atlas displays the surface elevation (in addition to
  latitude and longitude).  
* The minimum elevation figure (MEF) in a rectangular block (the size
  depends on the zoom level) is overlaid on the block.  This is useful
  for quickly determining safe altitudes.  For live scenery, this is
  automatic.  Pre-rendered maps have to be created with the new
  version of Map to have this feature.
* Atlas can have an arbitrary number of map sizes (before there were
  at most two: hires and, optionally, lowres).  The directory
  structure used to store them has thus changed.  Before, hires maps
  were stored in the Atlas directory, and lowres maps in a
  subdirectory called 'lowres'.  Now, maps are stored in a directory
  in the Atlas directory labelled with their size (eg, 1024x1024 maps
  are stored in the directory '10', since 2^10 = 1024).  So, to create
  maps at the sizes 16x16, 128x128, and 1024x1024, create 3
  directories, '4', '7', and '10'.  Map will automatically generate
  maps of the correct sizes, and Atlas will automatically load maps
  from the right directories at the right zoom levels.  Minimum map
  sizes are 1x1 ('0'), maximum are 32768x32768 ('15').
* Maps are now rendered slightly differently.  Before they had a
  trapezoidal shape, which caused small sub-pixel gaps to appear
  between the west and east edges of adjacent tiles.  Now they are
  rectangular, which lets them align exactly.
* Navaids are rendered better.  Navaid labels show Morse identifiers.
  VORs have compass roses, properly oriented.  VORs, VORTACs, TACANs,
  VOR-DMEs, and NDBs use standard icons.  ILSs are correctly
  positioned.  ILSs show localizer headings.  ILSs without glideslopes
  are drawn in a different colour than those with glideslopes.
* Atlas now displays airways.
* Airports show taxiways and aprons (this just required adding a
  colour for those materials in the Atlas palette file).  When zoomed
  in close, they also show frequencies (tower, ATIS, ...), runway
  lengths (in 100's of feet), airport elevation, and whether the
  airport has lighting.  Towered airports are drawn in blue;
  non-towered in purple.  A beacon symbol is drawn if the airport has
  one.
* Atlas can show angles in decimal degrees or degrees/minutes/seconds.
  Headings can be magnetic or true.
* Atlas now has a proper degree symbol.  However, this required
  creating a special font, so currently the number of font choices is
  ... one.  This will increase in the future if requested.
* Atlas has a search interface for navaids and airports.
* In addition to connecting to a live FlightGear instance, Atlas can
  read and write flight files.  In addition, the flight profile
  (speeed, altitude, and vertical speed) can be displayed in a
  separate graphs window.  Elevation graphs show glide slopes (if any
  are tuned in).
== Map ==
* Map is now solely dedicated to producing maps for Atlas; it no
  longer can create arbitrarily-sized maps, nor show navaids and
  airports.  These features may be added in again if demand is
  sufficient.
* Map has some new command line parameters (--png, --discrete-color,
  --nice-shading); others have been removed (--lat, --lon, --size,
  --scale, --airport-filter, --enable-airports, --enable-navaids,
  --singlebuffer, --headless, --glutfonts).
== MapPS ==
* MapPS is no longer (but may be replaced by - by a MapPDF? - if time
  and demand warrants).
== Atlas Palette ==
* Colours in the Atlas palette file can be labelled with arbitrary
  names, rather than just numbers.  There is no longer any requirement
  to specify elevations in sorted order.  Elevations can be given in
  metres (the default) or feet.
* Fixed bug in Atlas palette format - 'Material Elevation_<x>
  <colour>' now really does mean "everything at <x> and above is
  <colour>" (before it mistakenly meant "everything below <x> is
  <colour>").

New in 0.3.1
* New GetMap utility to fetch map image from wms servers ( landsat and al. ).
* Add a new --square option to Atlas to display square 1x1 degree image chunks.
* Fix problems with whitespaces in path.
* Fix map display problems at the pole.
* Use SimGear for offscreen (headless) rendering.
* Various fixes for buid-time and run-time.

New in 0.3.0
* ILS approaches displayed.
* Support for FlightGear's changed (again!) airport and navaid data formats.
* Off-screen rendering option for Map.
* Large map support added by tiling when required.
* Multiple scenery paths supported via FG_SCENERY or --fg-scenery.
* Bug fixes.

New in 0.2.3
* Support for FlightGear's changed airport data format.
* Default startup location and display options changed to match FlightGear (Bay Area).
* --airport=CODE startup option added.
* Patches to enable compilation with MSVC.
* Bug fixes.
