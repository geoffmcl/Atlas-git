Welcome to the Atlas project.
===================================================

The primary web page for this project is: http://atlas.sourceforge.net

For basic installation instructions see the "INSTALL" file.

To use the Atlas program, you must have some of the scenery from FlightGear
(a freeware flight simulator) installed. These files can be found at the
FlightGear homepage: http://www.flightgear.org

You also need to copy src/AtlasPalette from this package into your FlightGear
base directory (often /usr/local/lib/FlightGear).  If your FlightGear base
directory is somewhere else, you can either set the FG_ROOT environment
variable, or use the --fgroot=path command-line option to specify the
FlightGear base directory.

To build under Unix, follow these steps:

	automake
	./configure
	make
	make install

This project is GPL'd.  For complete details on our licensing please
