Welcome to the Atlas project.
===================================================

The primary web page for this project is: http://atlas.sourceforge.net

For basic installation instructions see the "INSTALL" file.

To use the Atlas program, you must have some of the scenery from FlightGear
(a freeware flight simulator) installed. These files can be found at the
FlightGear homepage: http://www.flightgear.org

You might need to help Atlas find the FlightGear base data directory
(often /usr/local/lib/FlightGear).  If your FlightGear base
directory is somewhere else, you can either set the FG_ROOT environment
variable, or use the --fgroot=path command-line option to specify the
FlightGear base directory.

To build under Unix, follow these steps:

	autoreconf --install
	./configure
	make
	make install

The `configure' shell script accepts a few Atlas-specific options:

`--with-fgbase=prefix'    specify the location of the FlightGear base package

   This points the root directory of the FlightGear installation (the
   directory which includes sub-directories such as Aircraft,
   Airports, Docs, Scenery, etc.)

`--with-plib=prefix'      specify the prefix path to plib

   If you use this option, `configure' expects to find two
   subdirectories here: `include/plib' (containing header files) and
   `lib' (containing libraries).

`--with-libcurl=prefix'   specify the prefix path to libcurl
